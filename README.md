## About

This project includes implementations of the Fibonacci series and the Lucas numbers. The Fibonacci Series starts with the integers 0 and 1 and proceeds by summing the previous two numbers. The Lucas Numbers are a related series starting with 2 and 1.

The module `series.py` contains functions to compute values in these series using a specified index, which we consider to start at zero (0).
